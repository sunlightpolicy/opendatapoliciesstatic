          <h1>Discover Open Data Policies</h1>
          <h2>Open Data Policies, for non-lawyers.</h2>
        </hgroup>
        <p>Open Data Policies Decoded provides the open data policies from many jurisidictions on 
        one friendly website. 
        <!-- Inline definitions, cross-references, bulk downloads, a modern API, and all of the 
        niceties of modern website design. --> 
        It’s like the expensive software lawyers use, but free and wonderful.</p>
        <p>This is a public beta test of Open Data Policies Decoded, which is to say that everything
        is under development. Things are funny looking, broken, and generally unreliable
        right now.</p>

          <h1>Inline Definitions</h1>
          <p>Throughout the ' . LAWS_NAME . ', very specific definitions are
          provided for terminology both specialized and mundane. If you don’t know which
          words have special definitions, and what those definitions are, then you can’t
          understand what a policy <em>really</em> means. ' . SITE_TITLE . ' solves this
          problem neatly, by identifying every definition in the  ' . LAWS_NAME . ' and
          providing a pop-up definition every time that a defined word appears.
          Definitions may come from different policies which helps you understand each
          policy in a national context.</p>

          <h1>Bulk Downloads</h1>
          <p>' . SITE_TITLE . ' isn’t just a pretty website—you can take the policies with
          you, too. On <a href="/downloads/">our downloads page</a> you can get copies
          of all of the open data policies in any format that you like, to do
          whatever you like with. They’re available in formats meant for you to read
          and in formats meant for software to read, too. If you’re a software developer,
          you’ll love our API!</p>
