<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Open Data Policies Decoded is a non-profit, non-governmental, non-partisan implementation of <a href="http://www.statedecoded.com" target="_blank">The State Decoded</a> brought to you by the folks at the <a href="http://opengovfoundation.org">OpenGov Foundation</a>. The State Decoded is a free, open source project that provides a platform to display legal information in a friendly, accessible, modern fashion. This instance was developed by the <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> with support from <a href="http://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/">What Works Cities</a> via <a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/">Bloomberg Philanthropies</a>. </p>
<h2>Beta Testing</h2>
<p>Open Data Policies Decoded is currently in public beta, which is to say that the site is under active development, with known shortcomings, but it has reached a point where it would benefit from being used by the general public (who one hopes will likewise benefit from it.) While every effort is made to ensure that the data provided on Open Data Policies Decoded is accurate and up-to-date, it would be gravely unwise to rely on it for any matter of importance while it is in this beta testing phase.</p>
<h2>Data Sources</h2>
The information that makes up Open Data Policies Decoded comes entirely from public sources. Throughout the site, links are provided to original data sources, whenever possible. 
<h2>API</h2>
<p>The site has a RESTful, JSON-based API.  <a href="https://github.com/statedecoded/statedecoded/wiki/API-Documentation">read the documentation</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Open Data Policies Decoded wouldn’t be possible without the contributions and years of work by <a href="http://waldo.jaquith.org/">Waldo Jaquith</a>, and the many dozens of people who participated in private alpha and beta testing of <a href="http://vacode.org/about/">Virginia Decoded</a>, the first <a href="http://www.statedecoded.com/">State Decoded</a> site, over the course of a year and a half, beginning in 2010. This platform on which this site is based, <a href="http://www.statedecoded.com/">The State Decoded</a>.
