The City of Greensboro’s OPEN DATA POLICY

City of Greensboro, NC

Information Technology Department

Policy Name: Open Data Policy

Document Reference Number: GSO-ITOPS-PM008

Version: 1.0

Effective from: Date of Signature by the City Manager

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The purpose of the City of Greensboro’s Open Data Policy is to provide guidelines and to implement best practices for City employees in the distribution of open data and the implementation of open data projects.

This policy applies to all City departments, employees, or others working on behalf of the City who are responsible for implementing open data related activities.

## DEFINITIONS

Data – A value or set of values that represents a specific concept or concepts. Data becomes information when analyzed and possibly combined with other data in order to extract meaning and provide context.

Data Governance Standards – an overarching set of best practices, procedures, and processes that define the vision and daily operation of an open data program, roles and responsibilities of leadership and data coordinators within the program, a method for identifying and prioritizing datasets for publishing and continuous updating, and a means for evaluating success of the open data program for improvement.

Dataset – means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.

Metadata – is "data that provides information about other data". Two types of metadata exist: structural metadata and descriptive metadata. Structural metadata is data about the containers of data. Descriptive metadata uses individual instances of application data or the data content.

Open Data – Public records as defined by NCGS-132 and provided in a convenient, modifiable form such that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to the use of the data. For the purposes of this policy, open data is made machine readable via Application Programming Interfaces (API), available in bulk, and provided in an open format such as a .CSV file. Greensboro’s open data is generated and maintained by the City, openly shared, and available to the public in accordance with public records laws.

Open Data Leadership Team – as defined by the data governance standards document is an empowered body of people representing the governance committee and shall consist of municipality executive leadership and inclusive of inputs from the public. This body will ensure adherence to the data governance standards established and will serve to modify those standards as necessary to ensure best practices can be achieved in an ever-changing technological or consumer environment.

Open Format – means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform independent, machine-readable method for formatting data that permits automated processing of such data and facilitates search capabilities.

Portal – a means, usually a technology application, for transmitting open data for use, reuse, and redistribution.

Publishable Data – data which is not protected or sensitive and which can be prepared for release to the public.

## Defining the Vision of the Greensboro’s Open Data Program and Initiatives

Open data created and maintained by the City of Greensboro is a public good and should be released to and leveraged in service of Greensboro’s residents, businesses, and institutions. Greensboro’s Open Data Program is a set of systems, technologies, and policies for maximizing the value of Greensboro’s data.

The open data program increases the value of city data by:
- Releasing data in service of transparency and community engagement, so that residents understand what their city is doing.
- Enabling city staff and the public to use the data in analyses and software applications that help Greensboro deliver services more efficiently.
- Providing businesses and other organizations with relevant data at no cost, so that Greensboro continues to maintain a thriving local economy.
- Removing silos between city departments, thereby fostering data-sharing and enabling efficiency improvements for city service delivery.

Greensboro’s Open Data Program is intended to increase community engagement, economic well-being, internal data sharing, data-driven decision-making, and government transparency. These outcomes are the result of efforts by the open data program and its stakeholders to supply city data and market it both internally and externally. Note that these outcomes are also affected by numerous intervening factors such as other city activities, city finances, and the state of the economy. More immediate outcomes of the open data program include an awareness of open data among both city staff and the public, as well as consistent growth of the supply of data.

### The City of Greensboro will develop and implement best practices that allow it to:

(1) Release all potential open City data, making it freely available in open formats without any licensing fees, with no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users to use for varying purposes;

(2) Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to encourage maximal use;

(3) Establish and maintain an open data web portal that provides a central location for published City data;

(4) Encourage innovative uses of the City’s publishable data by departments, the public, and other partners.

The development and implementation of these best practices shall be overseen by the Open Data Leadership Team. The requirements of this policy shall apply to any City Department, office, administrative unit, commission, board, advisory committee or other division/department of the City government including the records of third party agency contractors that create or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of a City division/department.

### The City of Greensboro’s respective departments will develop and implement best practices that allow it to:

- Confidence in City management and governance of data;
- Ability of third parties to leverage government data through application and service development that may bolster economic development, commerce, investment, and civic engagement;
- Provisioning of prompt, efficient services to residents providing the data behind key City priorities and decisions;
- Enhanced coordination and efficiencies among City Departments and partner organizations;
- Better informed decision making through the aggregation, synthesis, and analysis of Information previously contained in silos.

(2) Departments must also ensure that disseminated data, and all tools used to disseminate it, adhere to all standing City policies and standards, as well as applicable laws. Examples of applicable policies, standards, and laws include;
