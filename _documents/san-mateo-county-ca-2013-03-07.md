<p>ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM</p>
<p>COUNTY OF SAN MATEO</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Open Data Policy and Reporting Process</p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE DEPARTMENT: Information Services Department</p>
<p>NUMBER: F-5</p>
<br>
<h2>Background an Policy Overview</h2>
<p>On January 29, 2013 the Board of Supervisors adopted the County&#8217;s Community Impact Goals and initial Outcome Measures, and directed the County Manager and Chief Information Officer to develop an Open Data Policy and reporting process consistent with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Formation of an internal County Open Data Committee;</li>
<li>Designation of an Open Data Manager in the Information Services Department (ISO);</li>
<li>Designation of Department contact person(s) to work with internal/external auditors, County staff and Measure A Oversight Committee members, with respect to data submitted by his/her respective Department; and</li>
<li>Coordination between ISO and Departments to ensure the review of data sets for the Open Data Portal and compliance with existing policies governing public records and department/agency legal requirements and guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p>This policy outlines how San Mateo County will start its transition towards an &#8220;Open Government&#8221; through the democratization of data. The &#8220;Open Government&#8221; and &#8220;Open Data&#8221; movement is set to redefine the resident/government interaction so that government can be more transparent and accountable about tax payer money, more participatory by engaging with residents to add collective value to government, and collaborative through the use of innovative tools and methods.</p>
<p>This policy defines the appropriate methods for making data &#8220;Open&#8221; in San Mateo County which includes but is not limited to best practices for maintaining, sharing, and utilizing data. Additionally, it begins to outline how County Departments will participate in the County&#8217;s &#8220;Open Government&#8221; initiative through the timely and efficient application of data so that it improves organizational performance, service delivery, and civic engagement.</p>
<h2>Open Data Policy</h2>
<p>&#8220;Open Data&#8221; <span class="def-open">is a method by which data is made open and freely available to everyone to be republished or used as they wish.</span> It is one tool government can use to keep the residents and businesses within our communities engaged while developing transparent views of governmental data assets like budgetary spending or performance metrics.</p>
<ol>
<li>The definition and adoption of this Open Data Policy will serve as a framework and catalyst to enable the County to:
<ol type="a">
<li>improve <span class="g-goals-and-values">government transparency, accuracy, reliability and accountability;</span></li>
<li>track the <span class="g-goals-and-values">progress of organizational goals and outcome</span> measures;</li>
<li>enhance the County&#8217;s ability to <span class="g-goals-and-values">benchmark and to conduct comparative analyses;</span></li>
<li><span class="g-goals-and-values">develop new reports and applications based on </span>the County&#8217;s unique data;</li>
<li>increase civic engagement and resident involvement in County projects;</li>
<li><span class="g-goals-and-values">promote public-private partnerships</span> and inter/intra-governmental relationships;</li>
<li><span class="g-goals-and-values">empower the &#8220;Community&#8221; and County staff through the access of County data;</span></li>
<li>create <span class="g-goals-and-values">social and economic benefits based on innovation in how residents interact with government</span>.</li>
