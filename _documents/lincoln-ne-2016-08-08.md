A RESOLUTION regarding the City’s commitment to adopt a comprehensive
Open Data Initiative that shall be applied to as much City departmental data as is
practical.

WHEREAS, the City of Lincoln is committed to using technology to foster open,
transparent, and accessible government; and

WHEREAS, the purpose of the Open Data Initiative is to remove barriers and set
the rules by which City of Lincoln data is made available to the public as valuable,
machine-readable datasets.

WHEREAS, by sharing data freely, the City of Lincoln seeks to develop
opportunities for economic development and increased civic engagement for citizens of
Lincoln and Lancaster County; and

WHEREAS, publishing structured, standardized data in machine-readable
formats creates opportunities for information from different sources to be combined and
visualized in new and unexpected ways, for niche markets to be identified and
developed, and for citizens to browse, interpret, and draw attention to trends or issues
with greater efficiency; and

WHEREAS, Lincoln is a leader in the growth of the Silicon Prairie with new
businesses and professionals located in and around Lincoln; and

WHEREAS, the City of Lincoln seeks to encourage the local community to
develop applications and tools to collect, organize, and share public data in new and
innovative ways; and 

WHEREAS, software applications and tools that enable citizens to access,
visualize, and analyze public information will promote greater civic engagement and
encourage citizens to provide feedback on local issues; and

WHEREAS, the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security must be
maintained as a paramount priority; and

WHEREAS, a City Open Data Initiative will support and encourage the
development of Open Source software curricula in Lincoln area educational institutions
and foster a "Culture of Openness" that will increase the momentum behind Lincoln’s
efforts for the foreseeable future; and

WHEREAS, the adoption of an Open Data Initiative improves transparency,
access to public information, and improved coordination and efficiencies among
agencies and partner organizations across the public, non-profit, and private sectors.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the City Council of the City of
Lincoln, Nebraska that the City of Lincoln will, to the extent practical and financially
feasible:

1) Share pro-actively its open and accessible departmental datasets while
taking into consideration any existing data policies and adhering to rights
of privacy, security, and confidentiality as identified by federal, state, and
local privacy laws.

2) Publish datasets in a central location via Lincoln.ne.gov or any successor
site allowing for public development of digital applications that may
improve governmental transparency and public participation, enhance
access to City services, and, ultimately, strengthen democracy and
contribute to a more liveable city. 

3) Post on the City website procedures, supported file formats, glossary, and
other dataset context information to promote responsible use of City
information.

4) Identify appropriate City Representatives who shall comprise an Open
Data Governance Committee of City representatives and, to the extent
practical and financially feasible:

A. Encourage city departments to collaborate and to oversee
execution and implementation of the Open Data Initiative;

B. Identify existing and potential datasets for release as part of the
Open Data Initiative and work periodically with Information Services
and City departments to plan and develop of new datasets, review
existing datasets, set Open Data Initiative priorities, prioritize data
releases, recommend appropriate citation forms; maintain
descriptors that define the published data; publish datasets; and
release datasets online to the public where data/information in hard
copy (printed reports, posters, brochures, etc.) or soft copy (PDF,
web content, etc.) has already been released to the public,
including any available public feed;

C. Plan, implement, update, and identify metrics and measures of
current datasets when planning the creation of new
datasets/databases or scheduling technology enhancements;

D. Appropriately safeguard sensitive information; 

E. Incorporate public perspectives into policy implementation through
channels such as the Taking Charge survey or an online Open
Data survey portal;

F. Shall annually submit on or before July 1 of each year an Open
Data Initiative progress report with accompanying
recommendations to the Mayor and City Council.

G. Ensure information at the City is managed in ways that assist in
creating a culture of Open Government and information sharing by
providing open data governance and oversight;

H. Provide support to develop awareness and training programs to
help City staff incorporate Open Data practices into their business
planning processes;

I. Promote information transparency and accountability to build trust
and confidence in government and foster Open Government
leadership in recognition of the evolving democratic process.

5) The following principles shall be used to manage the City’s datasets:

A. Completeness: Released datasets will be as complete as possible
while complying with legal obligations regarding the release of
personal information, proprietary, or other confidential information.

B. Primacy: Datasets will be the primary source data with data
collection methods documented and published.

C. Timeliness: Datasets will be available to the public in a timely
fashion to maintain the business value of the data. To the extent
practical and financially feasible, data should be made available as 
close as possible to the time that it is collected. It is not enough to
mandate the one-time release of a data set, because it becomes
incomplete as soon as additional data is created but not published.
In order to ensure that published information is as accurate and
useful as possible, specific requirements regarding data timeliness
should be put in place by the Open Data Governance Committee.

D. Accessibility: Datasets will be as accessible as possible, with
accessibility defined as the ease with which information can be
obtained.

E. Machine-Readable: Datasets will be machine readable so that the
public can create applications that can use the data for new
services, research, or analysis.

F. Non-discrimination: Datasets will be available to anyone, with no
requirement for registration.

G. Permission shall be granted without charge or license to any
person obtaining City data and associated documentation files to
use, copy, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of
the data subject only to city copyright restrictions.

H. Long Term Access to Data: Datasets made available online should
remain online, with appropriate version-tracking and archiving over
time where applicable and available.

6) Definitions

A. Dataset: A collection of machine-readable, raw, non-manipulated
data usually presented in tabular form with associated metadata. 

B. Enterprise Information Management: A set of business processes,
disciplines, and practices used to manage the information created
from an organization's data.

C. Machine-readable Data: Data that, in order to be understood, must
be translated by a computer or other type of equipment. Portable
document format (PDF) is not machine- readable.

D. Open Data: Data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed
by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute
and share.

E. Open Government: A policy of promoting transparency,
accountability, and accessibility of good governance which fosters a
culture of collaboration and improved service delivery to the public.

F. Primary Source Data: Original information created or collected by
the City, details on how the data was created or collected, and the
original source documents recording the creation or collection of
the data.

G. Raw Dataset: A structured file format (including geospatial formats)
that can be read by a machine, such as spreadsheets, comma
delimited Extensible Markup Language (XML), Comma Separated
Values File (CSV), or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). A raw
dataset is not a report, a flyer, web applications, a PDF document,
or anything that cannot be exported or used by a machine.
