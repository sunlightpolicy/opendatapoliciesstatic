WHEREAS, the City Council (“City Council”) of the City of Bethlehem, (“City”) and the City administration (“Administration”), under the leadership of the Mayor, express their joint support for creating a more open, accountable, and accessible City government through the development and implementation of a financially and operationally feasible open data program, including the proactive publication of certain government information on a freely accessible open data online portal;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Bethlehem Charter Commission Report of Findings and Recommendation, dated July 27, 1959, which sets forth the City’s current form of government, City Council is authorized to establish policies by which the City is governed;

WHEREAS, the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law, 65 P.S. §§67.101 et seq., as amended, creates a presumption in favor of transparency and public access to certain government documents and the City of Bethlehem, Office of Open Records Right-to-Know Law Policy, dated April 13, 2016, as amended, governs release of certain City information in response to right to know requests from the public;

WHEREAS, municipalities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and throughout the country have implemented open data programs to promote certain policy objectives, which the City Council and Mayor hereby support, including program elements designed to: Increase government accountability, transparency, accessibility and foster greater civic engagement and participation in government; Improve municipal services and coordination among city agencies through data sharing and related applications; and Promote efficient use of City resources and tax revenue;

WHEREAS, City Council and Mayor believe that establishment of a robust open data program will advance the City’s strategic goals by improving the City’s capacity to develop and implement informed, evidence-based public policy and operating strategies, to collect, analyze, and synthesize information and utilize data analytics, and to better measure the effectiveness of municipal programs and services;

WHEREAS, open data programs can stimulate economic development, entrepreneurship, and community-based research by allowing data to be assembled, visualized, and analyzed in innovative ways for businesses, consumers, and researchers, by providing opportunities for data sharing partnerships between local government, educational institutions, non-profits, and the private sector, and by facilitating development of new applications and tools to collect, organize, and share public data for the benefit of  City residents and the general public, and City Council and the Mayor support these policy objectives; and

WHEREAS, implementation of this open data program must be balanced with the City’s need to operate in an efficient and cost-effective manner and its important obligations to comply with applicable law and regulation, to protect private and confidential information, and to ensure public safety; therefore, adoption of this Ordinance and implementation of the program is neither intended nor to be interpreted to alter, narrow or invalidate exceptions and exemptions from disclosure of records under the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law, 65 P.S. §§67.101 et seq., as amended, or any other Law and/or Policy as defined in this Ordinance.
