Open Data Policy
Purpose
The City of Milwaukee is committed to proactively publish data in a structured standardized machine
readable format to improve provision of services, increase transparency and access to public
information, and enhance coordination and efficiencies among departments, partner organizations
and citizens.
Scope
Data and information collected by the City which would advance the City’s transparency and
accountability through open data. Exceptions are provided for information that is Protected
Information or Sensitive Information. Data will be prioritized for publication based on relevance,
ease of access, and other criteria established by the Dept. of Administration-Information and
Technology Management Division, with review and affirmation by the City Information
Management Committee. While all eligible City data should be considered for publication,
capacity and demand will dictate the size and growth of the open data library.
Definitions
a. “Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or
created by or on behalf of a City department. “Data” does not include information provided to a
department or division by other governmental entities, nor does it include image files, such as
designs, drawings, maps, photos or scanned copies of original documents. Nothing in this
policy shall be deemed to prohibit the voluntary disclosure of information not otherwise defined
as “data.”
b. “Open data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal
encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without
fees [or a requirement of registration]. “Legal encumbrance” includes federal copyright and
privacy protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a
dataset may be used.
c. “Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machinereadable
data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis
and search capabilities. 
d. “Metadata” means the date the data was last updated, frequency of data refresh, how the
data is formatted, data field names and explanations for each field.
e. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data
organized or formatted in a consistent, specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form
f. “Protected information” means any data, dataset or portion thereof,that is not in the best
interests of the City to release. Protected information includes, but is not limited to, the
following:
1. Any data, data set or portion thereof to which a department or division may deny
access pursuant to the public records laws or any other provision of a federal or state
law, rule or regulation or local law;
2. Any data, data set that contains a significant amount of confidential data pursuant to
the preceding subsection and where removing such data would impose undue
financial or administrative burden;
3. Data that reflects the internal deliberative process of a department or division,
including but not limited to negotiating positions, future procurements, or pending or
reasonably anticipated legal or administrative proceedings;
4. Data stored on a department or division-owned personal computing device, or data
stored on a portion of a network that has been exclusively assigned to a single
department or division employee or a single department or division-owned or
controlled computing device;
5. Materials subject to copyright, patent, trademark, confidentiality agreements or trade
secret protection;
6. Proprietary applications, computer code, software, operating systems or similar
materials;
7. Employment records, internal employee-related directories or lists, and facilities data,
information technology, internal service-desk and other data related to internal
department or division administration;
8. Legacy Data. Any public data set that, due to its size or complexity, or due to
technology constraints, cannot be made available on the internet, shall be classified
as legacy. Departments or divisions shall make best efforts to avoid placing public
data sets into the legacy classification.
9. Any data, data set or portion thereof which contains any personally identifiable
information or financial identifying information that can be associated with a particular
individual through one or more identifiers or other information or circumstances and
specifically includes, but is not limited to, a private individual’s home address,
personal electronic mail address, personal telephone number, social security number
and/or driver’s license number.
g. “Sensitive information” means any data which, if published by the City online, could raise
privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health,
safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that
data.
h. ”Publishable data” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been
prepared for release to the public.

no restrictions on use or reuse, and fully accessible to the broadest range of users;
2. Publish high quality, updated data with documentation (metadata) and permanence to
encourage maximum use;
3. Provide or support access to free, historical archives of released city data;
4. Measure the effectiveness of datasets made available through the Open Data Program
by connecting open data efforts to the city’s programmatic priorities;
5. Minimize limitations on the disclosure of public information while appropriately
safeguarding protected and sensitive information; and
6. Support innovative uses of the city’s publishable data by agencies, the public, and other
partners.

and the City Information Management Committee, who will work with the city’s departments and
divisions to:
1. For each city department or division, identify appropriate contact information for a lead
open data coordinator who will be responsible for managing that department’s or
division’s participation in the Open Data Program;
2. Oversee the creation of a comprehensive inventory of datasets held by each city
department or division which is published to the central open data location and is
regularly updated;
3. Develop and implement a process for determining the relative level of risk and public
benefit associated with potentially sensitive, non-protected information so as to make a
determination about whether and how to publish it;
4. Develop and implement a process for prioritizing the release of datasets which takes into
account new and existing signals of interest from the public (such as the frequency of
public records requests), the city's programmatic priorities, existing opportunities for data
use in the public interest, and cost;
5. Proactively consult with members of the public, department staff, journalists,
researchers, and other stakeholders to identify the datasets which will have the greatest
benefit to city residents and civic improvement in Milwaukee if published in a high quality
manner;
6. Establish processes for publishing datasets to the central open data location, including
processes for ensuring that datasets are high quality, up-to-date, are in use-appropriate
formats, and exclude protected and sensitive information;
7. Ensure that appropriate Metadata is provided for each dataset in order to facilitate its
use;
8. Develop and oversee a routinely updated, public timeline for new dataset publication;
and
9. Ensure that published datasets are available for bulk download, to the extent practicable.
