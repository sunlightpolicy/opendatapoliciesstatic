## Statement

Open Data Cincy is an aggregate repository incorporating municipal and other data to
more completely and accurately capture quality of life data and information about our
community. OpenDataCincy.org features data sets, applications and APIs that provide access to
useful and significant regional data and is searchable, allowing free downloads to encourage
more engaged and knowledgeable consumer citizens.

In order to show its commitment to using technology to foster open, transparent, and
accessible government, the City of Cincinnati desires to participate in this initiative, joining
cities like Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco. The goal of free sharing of data is more
than transparency, however, but also fostering economic development opportunities, increased
investment and civic engagement for citizens. The adoption of open standards further improves
transparency, access to public information, and improved coordination and efficiencies among
bureaus and partner organizations across the public, non-profit and private sectors.

Publishing structured standardized data in machine readable formats creates new
opportunities for information from different sources to be combined and visualized in new and
unexpected ways, for niche markets to be identified and developed and for citizens to browse,
interpret and draw attention to trends or issues with greater efficiency. Specifically, Cincinnati’s
local software community, including its educational partners, can develop software applications
and tools to collect, organize. and share public data in new and innovative ways.
