SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 727

STATE OF NEW JERSEY

217th LEGISLATURE

ADOPTED MAY 23, 2016

SYNOPSIS: “New Jersey Open Data Initiative” to require certain information be provided on Internet to public and State agencies.

CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT: As reported by the Assembly State and Local Government Committee on September 19, 2016, with amendments.

<br>

AN ACT requiring that certain information be provided on the
Internet to the public and to State departments and agencies, and
supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.

BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State
of New Jersey:

<br>

**1\.** This act shall be known and may be cited as the “New Jersey
Open Data Initiative.”

<br>

**2\.** The Legislature finds and declares:

a. <span class="g-build-on-precedent">It is in the interest of this State to increase public awareness of and access to the data created by and available from State agencies because such data can enhance transparency and accountability, encourage public engagement, and stimulate public policy and public service innovation;</span>

b. The data generated by the Executive Branch of State government can spur economic development because it enables private sector companies to use such data to produce innovative and creative items and services that benefit the citizens of this State;

c. <span class="g-goals-and-values">The efficient integration, management, and governance of data will greatly improve State government programs and the delivery of a wide range of services to New Jersey’s citizens, thereby enhancing their lives.</span>

d. At the same time, it is vitally important that the data held by
one State agency be made readily available to other State agencies
with a minimum of administrative hurdles, so that data shared
across the Executive Branch contribute to the
effective and cost-efficient delivery of a wide range of government
information and services; and

e. The Office of Information Technology, with the cooperation
of the Department of the Treasury, is the appropriate agency to
develop, coordinate, and oversee the presentation of government
data to the public and the sharing of information among State
government agencies so that the information and services those
agencies provide can be delivered in the most efficient and cost-
effective manner possible.

<br>

**3\.** As used in this act:

“Agency” means any of the principal departments of the
Executive Branch, including the Department of the Treasury, and

<span class="def-data">related to the mission of that State department or agency.</span>

“Dataset” means a named collection of related, digitally-stored
data with the collection containing individual data units organized

<span class="g-sensitive-information"><span class="g-partnerships">with the Attorney General, to ensure that the data is used in a</span></span>
<span class="g-sensitive-information"><span class="g-partnerships">manner that is secure and in conformity with State law.</span></span>

the public and other agencies; and d) such other items as the Chief
Technology Officer or the State Treasurer deems necessary. The

c. (C. )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) or
related sections of current law.

implementation of the act.
