ARTICLE IV. - OPEN DATA AND PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-14, § 1, adopted May 27, 2014, effective June 26, 2014, amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. IV, §§ 2-446—2-450, pertained to public records, and derived from Code 1977, §§ 1.214—1.217, 1.222.


## Sec. 2-446. - Findings and purpose.

Whereas the city creates and retains a large array of data; and

Whereas the city council recognizes this information as a community asset and desires a more proactive stance regarding appropriate dissemination thereof; and

Whereas by fostering civic engagement through data sharing between city agencies, citizens, businesses, and other community organizations, the city council hopes to use data to improve coordination, collaboration, and efficiency with public stakeholders; and

Whereas data is a valuable asset to private entities, the city council wants to encourage businesses and other citizen enterprises to make use of government data in ways that will promote economic development and increased local investment; and

Whereas governmental decisions are influenced by the analysis of specific data it is imperative that the city council offer enhanced access in order to improve transparency and efficiency of review; and

Whereas no City in Michigan or any American city with a population under one hundred thousand (100,000) has an open data policy, the city council wishes to become a flagship for transparency and leader among peer cities in terms of data sharing; and

Whereas the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) affords citizens a way to request information from their government, the city council recognizes that proactively providing information potentially reduces administrative and financial costs associated with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) compliance;

The City of Jackson now finds that adopting an open data policy fosters greater transparency and accountability in city affairs. Data and records are collected and curated as described in the sections below.

(Ord. No. 2014-14, § 1, 5-27-14)

For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:

Creative Commons 0 [Zero] Waiver. The term "Creative Commons 0 [Zero] Waiver" shall refer to the rules governing the uses of datasets, and the inclusion of a Creative Commons 0 Waiver dedicates published data to the public domain. Users are thereby encouraged to copy, modify, and distribute the work, even for commercial purposes, all without requesting permission. Broadly this includes the constellation of abilities to retrieve, download, index, sort, search, and reuse data for novel purposes.

Metadata. The word "metadata" is defined as "data about data," metadata refers to descriptions of the content or context of a given dataset. The fields of metadata are defined in the Federal Government's Common Core Standards (project-open-data.github.io/schema). Metadata may include but is not limited to title, description/summary, keyword tags, date of creation/modification, departmental origin, and contact point for the data asset.

Open data. The word "open data" shall refer to structured data (i.e. Tabular or relational, such as spreadsheets and databases, and as opposed to solely textual documents) that is collected, created, or stored by the city that is a matter of public record or otherwise accessible by a FOIA request. This ordinance does not require or restrict posting public records outside of the open data portal. Open data shall include but not be limited to:

1. Spatial (GIS).
2. Tabular (.csv or spreadsheets).
3. Live web feeds (RSS, XML).
4. Budget, financial, and performance data.
5. Data and figures contained in published documents such as finished reports, grant applications, etc.

Open format. The term "open format" shall mean the format of data is platform-independent, non-proprietary, human- and machine-readable, and where appropriate made available to the public without restrictions that impede reuse of the data.

Record. The word "record," as used in this article, shall mean any proceeding, book, document, report, contract, receipt, voucher, correspondence or paper.

(a)     Unless otherwise specified in this article, the city manager shall establish rules and standards to implement an open data policy, including developing standards to determine which data sets are appropriate for public disclosure.

These rules shall, whenever possible, use open formats with non-proprietary technical standards for web publishing and e-government; and
2. Guidelines for departments to follow in developing their plans for implementing the open data policy consistent with the standards established by the city manager. Each plan shall include an accounting of public data sets under control of the department; and
3. Rules for including open data requirements in applicable city contracts; and
