## I. SCOPE

This Open Data Policy shall apply to all Departments of the City of Arlington. This Policy only pertains to public data chosen for open data release. Creation of this Policy does not create an obligation to populate any class of data to the City’s Open Data Portal.

1. Instill confidence and credibility through Open Data standards fostering
increased transparency for Arlington citizens and its business community.
2. Proactively share data in order to improve and encourage increased economic activity, development, and civic engagement by maximizing the value of public data.

the City of Arlington to reduce the duplication of services.

B. To achieve these policies, it is the objective of the City of Arlington to:
1. Prepare an annual report and comment on the state of the current Open Data
program.

C. “Dataset” means identified organized collection of data. The most basic form of a Dataset is data elements presented in a tabular form, with each data element represented by a column. Each row corresponds to a given value of that column’s data elements. Datasets may also present information in non-tabular formats such as a geospatial data file.

Data shall not be Open Data if it meets the definition of Sensitive/Restricted.
