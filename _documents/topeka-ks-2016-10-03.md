Purpose: To provide guidelines to the City of Topeka departments and employees in the distribution of open data and the implementation of open data projects.
Applicability: To all city employees, departments and others that may work on behalf of the City who are responsible for implementing open data related activities.

Effective Date: October 3, 2016


## I. POLICY

A. The City of Topeka (“City”) is committed to the spirit of open government, building upon existing open records laws, including the Kansas Open Records Act (K.S.A. 45-215 et seq.), expanding the data making it available to the public and providing resources for understanding this data.

B. The adoption of an Open Data Policy improves provision of services, increases transparency and access to public information and enhances coordination and efficiencies among departments and partner organizations.

C. Incorporating data that is collected by various City departments into a single location will facilitate the ability to aggregate, analyze and synthesize it to better allocate public resources.

D. Access to public information, including access to public data, promotes a higher level of civic engagement and allows citizens to provide valuable feedback to government officials regarding local issues.

E. One goal of an Open Data Policy is to proactively publish information currently sought through open records requests, thereby benefiting all parties involved by saving time and money.

F. Information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for open government and good government generally.

G. The protection of privacy, confidentiality, public safety and security must be maintained as a paramount priority and must be balanced with the City’s desire to enhance transparency and accountability through open data.

H. The Open Data Policy supports the City’s desire to be interconnected and fosters innovation for its residents; increases transparency, accountability and comparability; promoting economic development and research; and improves internal performance.
