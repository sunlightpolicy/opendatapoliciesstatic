<p>The ideal of online data is “real time” access: data should be made available as close as possible to the time that it is collected. It is not enough to mandate the one-time release of a data set, because it becomes incomplete as soon as additional data is created but not published. In order to ensure that the information published is as accurate and useful as possible, specific requirements should be put in place to make sure government data is released as close as possible to the time that it is gathered and collected.</p>
<p>While sometimes challenging, this kind of rapid publishing becomes less of a burden when combined with others measures for digitizing data collection and publishing, such as electronic filing (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#data-collection">Provision 21</a>), central data locations (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#data-portals-and-websites">Provision 18</a>) and APIs (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#public-apis">Provision 20</a>).</p>
